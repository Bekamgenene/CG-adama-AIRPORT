Ethiopian Airport(airforce) Simulation Using OpenGL
Introduction:
The aim of this project is to create a visually appealing and immersive simulation
of an airport environment using both 2D and 3D graphics in OpenGL. The
simulation will include various elements such as an airplane, runway, terminal
buildings, vehicles, and clouds, rendered in a dynamic graphical interface. This
project will serve as a demonstration of computer graphics principles and
techniques, showcasing the capabilities of OpenGL in creating realistic and
engaging visual content.
Objectives:
1. Visual Representation: To create a realistic and colorful representation of
an airport environment, including the runway, terminal buildings, and
surrounding landscape using both 2D and 3D graphics.
2. 2D and 3D Animation: To implement animations for the airplane taking off
and landing in 3D, while also incorporating 2D elements for the background
and other static features.
3. Learning Experience: To enhance understanding of OpenGL functions, 2D
and 3D graphics rendering, and animation techniques.
Project Components:
1. Airport Layout:
 Runway: A long strip where airplanes take off and land, represented
with white lines to indicate the runway markings in 2D.
 Terminal Buildings: Various 3D models representing airport
facilities, including check-in counters, waiting areas, and shops.
 Control Tower: A tall 3D structure for air traffic control, designed to
be visually distinct from other buildings.

2. Airplane Animation:
 A 3D model of an airplane that will move along the runway,
simulating takeoff and landing.

 The airplane will be animated to show realistic movement, including
acceleration and deceleration, with appropriate scaling and rotation to
enhance the 3D effect.
3. Vehicle Movement:
 Ground vehicles such as baggage carts and fuel trucks will be
animated to move around the airport, simulating real airport
operations in a 3D space.
 2D representations of vehicles can also be used for static elements in
the background.
4. Clouds and Sky:
 A dynamic sky with 3D clouds that move across the screen, enhancing
the visual appeal of the simulation.
 The sky will change colors to simulate different times of the day,
providing a more immersive experience.

5. Lighting and Texturing:
 Implement lighting effects to simulate sunlight and shadows, adding
depth to the 3D environment.
 Use textures on buildings, vehicles, and the runway to enhance
realism.

6. 2D Background Elements:
 Incorporate 2D graphics for static elements such as the ground, trees,
and other landscape features to complement the 3D models.
 Use 2D sprites for additional details like signage and decorations
around the airport.

Technical Implementation:
 Programming Language: C/C++ with OpenGL and GLUT for rendering.
 Graphics Library: OpenGL for both 2D and 3D graphics rendering.

 Development Environment: Dave C++ or any suitable IDE that supports
OpenGL development.
Expected Outcomes:
 A fully functional airport simulation that demonstrates the principles of both
2D and 3D computer graphics.
 An engaging visual experience with realistic animations and a dynamic
environment.
 A comprehensive understanding of OpenGL rendering techniques and
animation principles in both 2D and 3D contexts.
Conclusion:
This project will enhance our understanding of OpenGL and computer graphics
while providing a platform to showcase creativity and technical skills. The 2D and
3D airport simulation will serve as an engaging visual experience, demonstrating
the potential of computer graphics in creating immersive environments. We look
forward to your support and feedback on this proposal
